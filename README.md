# time_seres_heart_rate_prediction
Time Series – Prediction Task - Heart rate prediction

## 1. Heart rate prediction
Sudden variations in heart rate could lead to the risks of stroke, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, and even death. Therefore, monitoring the heart rate is critical as it helps to discover the irregularities of the heart’s function to detect health problems. With the advancements in AI and stream processing technologies, more accurate future predictions can be made, allowing healthcare sectors to detect and treat such situations at early stages.
In this task, you are given a time series collected using medical sensors, approximately four hours of data for a patient. Using these data, you need to build an effective time series model to predict the next twenty (20) observations (minutes) of heart rate data (Lifetouch Heart Rate). You can use any time series model you want, either from the sessions or your own research based on the topics we discussed.

## 2. Data set
Within the data folder, there are 6 .csv files available.

PiD…csv (5 files)
Additional time series data.
They are provided to experiment with different time series models covered in this module to get hands-on experience.

PT_Train.csv
Training data for modelling and to use with future predictions that are required for the submission

Note: The final predictions (for submission) should be made for the data in PT_Train.csv, and other files (PiD…csv) are provided as resources to practice learning algorithms and analyse their behaviour.
